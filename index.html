                <h2>Exploring Human-Computer Interaction: Understanding User-Centered Design<br><br></h2>

                <p>In today’s digital world, technology is only as effective as its usability. 
                That’s where Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) comes in. 
                HCI is the study of how people interact with computers and digital systems, emphasizing intuitive design, user satisfaction, and accessibility. 
                Our textbook, Foundations of Human-Computer Interaction, dives deep into the principles of HCI, equipping readers with the knowledge to design and evaluate systems that put users first.
                This week, we explore the fundamental concept of User-Centered Design (UCD)—a core principle in HCI that ensures digital products meet real user needs. 
                UCD is an iterative process that involves understanding user behavior, designing with empathy, and continuously refining interfaces based on feedback. 
                By following a user-centered approach, designers and developers create software, websites, and applications that are not only functional but also engaging and inclusive.<br><br></p>
                    
                <h2>Why User-Centered Design Matters<br><br></h2>

                <p>Imagine using an app that’s confusing or a website that takes forever to navigate. Frustrating, right? 
                That’s the challenge UCD aims to solve. When designers prioritize the user experience from the start, they enhance usability, reduce errors, and improve overall satisfaction. 
                The key stages of UCD include:<br><br></p>
       
                <ol>
                    <li>User Research – Gathering insights through surveys, interviews, and usability tests to understand user needs.</li>
                    <li>Prototyping – Creating wireframes and mockups to visualize and refine design concepts.</li>
                    <li>User Testing – Observing real users interacting with prototypes and gathering feedback for improvement.</li>
                    <li>Iteration – Refining the design based on feedback to create a seamless user experience.</li>
